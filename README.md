# DSA-Codes

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is where I keep all my Data Structures and Algorithms code from my second semester.

## What's in here?

Just a bunch of programs I wrote while learning DSA:
- Arrays and linked lists stuff
- Stack and queue implementations 
- Tree and graph algorithms
- Sorting methods (bubble sort, merge sort, etc.)
- Search algorithms

## Why I made this

I created this repo to:
- Keep track of my assignments
- Have a reference for exam prep
- Share code with classmates when we study together

Nothing fancy here - just my coding journey through DSA class! Feel free to check out the code if you're learning these concepts too.

*Note: These are college assignments, so they're focused on demonstrating concepts rather than being super optimized.*
